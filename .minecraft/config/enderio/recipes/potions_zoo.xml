<!-- 

These are the built-in recipes. You cannot change this file, it is a
reference for you only and will be generated every time the game starts.

To make changes to the recipes, copy the recipes you want to change to
a file in the 'user' folder.

You can also disable all built-in recipes with the setting "loadCoreRecipes"
in the Ender IO config file, so that only your files in the 'user' folder will
be loaded. Please be advised that a number of recipes are absolutely needed,
so you will have to copy those over into a 'user' file for the game to load.

More information on the syntax can be found in the recipes.xsd file. An
XML editor will display that as tooltips when editing this file.
